360863,1124282,2012-04-13,1853183,Anna,"We stayed at  Humberto's apartment for 9 days in April. The apartment is really comfortable, bright and quiet. We never heard neighbors) . Also, we liked the location of apartment. It is very close to the beach, and a 15-minute walk from the historic center of Barcelona. Barcelona city tour buses stop right on the waterfront next to the house.  We've not meet Humberto in person (once we talked on the phone), but throughout our stay, he gave us useful advices about interesting places and good restaurants and bars, and answered on all our questions via SMS or Whatsapp. We like everything  very much! <br/>We would like to thank Humberto - he's a great host!<br/>Anna"

17475,83802,2010-08-24,68687,John,"Luca is very personable, and the views are exactly as advertised.  For $88 a night, not a bad deal."
17475,98998,2010-09-17,96055,Xiaoyang,"I am glad we found Luca's apt for our stay in Barcelona.  It gave us the convenient access all the tourist attractions while getting a flavor of the lives of the locals--watching saglada familia in the twilight from the terrace in the aroma of the local bakery was one of my favorite moments in Barcelona.  The apt is also very clean and furnished with good taste, centrally located but suprisingly quiet.  Luca, his friends and even the super in the building were all very helpful and accommodating.  I would like to thank them for making our time in Barcelona enjoyable."
17475,105280,2010-09-26,171084,Amy,"I should start by saying we really did not want to leave this apartment. The space is amazing, and the apartment had everything we needed. The two balconies were perfect for enjoying the evenings before going out, and watching sunset/sunrise over Sagrada Familia. Luca made sure everything was in perfect shape when we arrived, and was very responsive when we had some trouble with the internet. It was very rainy in Barcelona, which we did not anticipate, and Luca gave us perfect rainy day suggestions. The apartment is very clean and airy, and quite spacious. The location is perfect, and the bakery downstairs (La Boulangerie) is amazing. Overall, an excellent experience in a beautiful apartment with a great host! Thanks Luca!"
17475,109755,2010-10-02,31238,Mike,"Luca was a very gracious host and took efforts to make sure that our stay at his apartment went well and was comfortable. Though the apartment and some of its amenities may not be in tip top condition (which Luca will tell you), it is a good value because the location, the space and the views more than make up for it. I highly recommend Luca and his apartment."
17475,165392,2011-01-04,287566,Andrew,Fantastic place! Really enjoyed staying here and would definitely stay next time in Barcelona. Highly recommended.
17475,183810,2011-02-17,306891,Amol,"Overall a very good host, good location, and nice place.<br/><br/>I had bad luck I guess -- the Internet company cut off Luca's modem just before I arrived and it was a problem for me. Hard to survive with no Internet.<br/><br/>Otherwise it would have been terrific -- he really has it set up well and it's a very nice building/area."

17475,260350,2011-05-12,373379,Jack,Luca's flat is in a beautiful and in a charming neighborhood in Barcelona. The views are great and we had a wonderful stay. Luca met us and gave us helpful insight to the city. I would happily stay here again. Jack M.

17475,404561,2011-07-29,772710,Lucy,"Fab apartment, in a lovely neighbourhood in Barcelona. Near all vital facilities, and although not central all attractions are in walking distance. The roof terraces and view of Sagrada Familia, especially at night was priceless. Although Luca was unable to meet us the keys were easy to collect and Luca was very prompt in replying to any queries and gave some very useful tips of the local area. A recommended apartment and with a very helpful host! "
17475,502234,2011-09-05,12392,Alexandra,"Summary: The views were stunning, and the apartment was very spacious, but we encountered problem after problem. This was not our first time staying with Airbnb, so we were ready for the apartment to be just that - an apartment, not a hotel. However, as it turned out for us, it would have been better to stay in a hotel. Luca ended up refunding us 40% which we think is fair. The details: There are none of the amenities of a hotel, not even towels that look like they're clean. I believe they were clean, but they were stained, which I found kind of gross. When you arrive, the apartment is all shut down and the bed is unmade; we found sheets hanging in the living room that we had to use to make the bed ourselves. There was a little toilet paper in the bathroom, but we ended up having to buy more for ourselves, as well as toothpaste, and other basic toiletries. The apartment isn't especially clean. I kept finding other people's hair in various places, especially on the couch, which also had some stains. The kitchen counter was stained, and the trash can cover was dirty and unpleasant to have to keep touching to put trash in. All of the above wouldn't really have been a problem, but then real issues started arising. We didn't have hot water to begin with, so Luca, being out of town, had his friend come over to try to help fix it (this friend is not a plumber). The solution his friend came up with was to turn on the radiators while we showered so the hot water would work. Not an ideal situation for August in Spain. Luca did not get us a plumber. Next the internet broke down. The Orange card Luca has for guests in the apartment ran out of charge, so there was no way for us to contact him by phone because he was out of the country. Again, we had to go through his friend, calling from a pay phone down on the street. Luca refilled the card promptly but because of a problem Orange had, we didn't have internet for most of our stay. We realize this wasn't his fault, but it made getting in touch with him about the other issues very difficult. Finally, midway through our stay, the elevator to the building broke, with us in it. We were stuck for a little while but got out. The main problem was that we had to walk up and down the 9 floors to Luca's apartment for the remainder of our stay. The building is old and not especially well kept, and the elevator service man did not come to fix it when he said he would. We ended our stay by dragging our suitcases down 9 flights of stairs. We fully acknowledge that we had bad luck and that not all of this was Luca's fault, but he did not do a..."

17475,569277,2011-09-26,994674,Arturo,"I absolutely LOVED this apartment!!! I stayed with my mom for the Merce festival. The views are indeed a delight and the location is perfect. I would add that you can see Torre Agbar when it's lit up if you lean out the front window.<br/><br/>Also, I'd recommend bringing a laptop so you can plug in a USB device (actually pretty convenient as you'll have it everywhere) or an unlocked iPad 3G because that's how you get Internet for this. I only brought a smartphone so wasn't able to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Key pickup and drop off was smooth. I really do wish I could have met Luca. In any case, being able to stay at a place such as this only gives me the desire to come back again.<br/><br/>Thank you so much!!! "
17475,749168237706573217,2022-10-30,26134807,Alejandro,"great place, awesome view.  the comms also very good"

17475,867279270614996952,2023-04-11,40808705,Uma,"We had a great stay, very well located flat with an awesome terrace:)"
17475,879527969658387860,2023-04-28,20850604,Claudia,"we would have loved to have stayed here, but unfortunately, the building facade was under construction and between the noise and the dust, it would have made for a not-great trip. luca and his team were incredibly responsive and helpful and i received a full refund."
17475,963578113124904405,2023-08-22,6308552,Marco,"The apartment is in a very good location and has a lovely terrace facing the Sagrada Familia. However, the building is currently undergoing complete renovation. This means that there is a lot of dust on all floors including the apartment. In addition, the renovation team works from 8am to 5pm and the noise is intense - there are days when the hammering seems to be inside the apartment. In a normal situation and with the renovated apartment, I believe it is a great stay, but in the current conditions it was stressful. Luca was very kind and sought solutions with us, he also tried to show the conditions of the apartment before our arrival. However the noise issue was way more than expected. Not sure if we would have stayed there if we knew how bad it was. Would recommend this place if there was no renovation going on."
17475,987522940768099316,2023-09-24,43359003,Pauline,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Luca. L'appartement était conforme à la description et l'emplacement super. La terrasse est un gros plus, la vue sur la Sagrada Familia est imprenable ! <br/>L'immeuble étant en travaux en ce moment, nous étions parfois réveillées tôt par les ouvriers qui commençaient leur travail, mais l'hôte nous avait prévenu avant notre arrivée, ce n'était donc pas une surprise. Il y a eu quelques petits inconvénients dans l'appartement (Vaisselle pas très bien nettoyée, évacuation de la douche presque bouchée), nous avons fait part de ces commentaires à Luca qui a tout de suite été très reactif sur le sujet.<br/>Luca est un super hôte, très sympathique, disponible et flexible. Malgré notre retard de train conséquent, l'entrée dans l'appartement s'est faite sans soucis.<br/>Nous recommandons cet appartement à qui souhaite visiter Barcelone en profitant d'un appartement confortable et d'un extérieur agréable !"
17475,1007136314239391230,2023-10-21,99531457,Catherine,"The apartment is in a good location with the most fabulous rooftop terrace looking towards La Sagrada Familia. You can almost touch it. It's a twenty minute easy walk down to the city centre by taking the bustling Sant Joan with plenty of cafes and restaurants. (If visiting the Picasso museum, don't forget to book your free Thurs eve tickets online!) The Metro is two minutes away and there are a few multi ticket options at great value. Heading in any direction from the apartment will be endlessly fascinating. The apartment itself is lovely, although I have to be honest and say that the bathroom and kitchen could do with an upgrade. The compensatory factor is the simply spectacular terrace, which is breathtaking. There is currently major road works outside, and builders in the apartment block Monday to Friday, but you will be out and about, so it really is not a problem. ( P.S. The supermarket in the same block, directly behind the apartment, is cheapest for wine at 2 euros a bottle!)"

Luca y su equipo siempre fueron muy atentos y me apoyaron en todo lo que necesite.  Volvería sin pensarlo. Excelente zona, realmente puedes hacer todo caminando. Gracias por todas sus atenciones."
17475,1039019335406949488,2023-12-04,518537992,Josee,Nous avons adoré notre séjour car l’appartement est vraiment bien situé  . Il y a vraiment une vue incroyable sur Barcelone  et la Sagrada Familia  quand on est dans  l’appartement et sur la terrasse .<br/>C’est magnifique comme endroit pour séjourner longtemps nous y avons été 11 jours et y serions restés encore . Il y’a des commodités et épiceries à proximité  . <br/>Les hôtes ont été très sympathiques et attentifs à nos besoins .

17475,1083935681188778947,2024-02-04,186426452,Elena,"This is a lovely apartment with a great location. It was clean when we arrived, thank you! The terrace is a delight, we had a great time there!<br/>It is very convenient to walk and get to all points of the city. The view from the apartment is gorgeous. Yes, there were renovations in the house, but this was not a big problem for us."

360863,1221395,2012-05-03,840509,Laura,"Humberto is a very careful host! We did not meet Humberto in person but we did have open and easy communication on mobile phone prior the trip (when he updated me with information and explained how to get to the apartment), we checked in (to ensure we got acquainted with usage instructions of the apartment properly (which was very useful tips!) and during our stay.<br/>Apartment itself is very bright, pleasant and easy to use. Location of the apartment is fantastic - you can reach Gothic region in ~10 - 15 mins; metro station in 10 mins and thus reach any other spot of Barcelona rather quick. <br/>Acoustics on the street is very good so I would suggest you close windows if you don't want to be woken up in the middle of night because of noise on street (I suppose someone were playing football somewhere not rather far…). But neighbours of the building were 'invisible'. And be prepared to bring your luggage to the 5th floor :)"
360863,1272021,2012-05-13,2168871,Sergei,"I've stayed there in early May. The place is exactly what it is shown on the photos. Very comfy, has all the kitchen stuff, dish washer and so on. Location is very good too, close to the beach and old town as well. Food market is few steps away. Host is very welcoming and provides a lot of useful tips on where to eat and so on. I'm considering staying at this place again in Autumn.<br/>"
360863,2261440,2012-09-11,1198263,Katalin,"<br/>In September we stayed for a week in Humberto’s flat. The flat’s location is great; it is only one minute away from the beach. Nearby you can find everything you need (market, grocery store, bakery etc.). On the beach you can find a lot of restaurants and clubs. On our arrival, there we some tiny technical problems and Humberto solved these problems immediately. With his useful tips our vacation was unforgettable in Barcelona. I definitely recommend him and his place! <br/>Katalin"
360863,2635859,2012-10-16,3744877,Till,"We had a really wonderful time in Barcelona. Humbertos place is really nice and very clean. He gave us so much valuable information about the city and neighborhood, including restaurants etc. The place is nice, tastefully equipped and so close to the beach!<br/>Once there was a problem with the stairway lights which was fixed immediatley after I mailed Humberto. He is there for you even if he´s not in the city. You can call/mail him when there a questions.<br/>I loved it there, and I like to come again!!!"
360863,3672914,2013-03-02,5193775,Antony,Humberto was an excellent host and provided us with more than enough helpful information about the apartment and the local area. <br/><br/>The flat was exact to the pictures and was very clean and tidy. The location was brilliant! Very close to the beach and the local fresh food market. The produce was excellent! I would definitely recommend staying here if you enjoy cooking and an authentic Barcelona experience :)<br/>We would love to stay again!<br/>
360863,3982512,2013-04-01,5205414,Marc,"We had a great time in Barcelona. The flat was very nice, clean  and exact like the pictures. The location is brilliant; 5 minutes walking to the beach, 10 minutes for the metro and 20 minutes to  La Ramblas. You can find al the shops you need in the nearest streets. We were with 4 persons, 2 adults and two children of 16 and 13 years old. There was place enough. We had al what we needed. The contact with Humberto was very good. We did not met him but he gave us a lot of information of the flat and BCN over the phone. That was very helpfull because it was the first time we went there. Checking in and out was very easy. You can find a lot of documentation in the flat. When we go back to BCN it will be in Humberto's flat.<br/>"
360863,4086631,2013-04-08,5679178,Norman,"My stay at Humberto's flat was really nice. Humberto was a nice host, providing lots of cool information about places and things to do. The appartement is like shown in the fotos and really clean. I can recommend it. "
18674,4808211,2013-05-27,4841196,Caron,"Great location. Clean, spacious flat. Would recommend to anyone."
360863,4238730,2013-04-21,3693913,Susanne,"We spent 4 nights in Humberto's beautiful apartment and enjoyed it from the first to the last moment. The location is great close to the sea, the market, the ""best"" bakery of town, and to the touristic places of Barcelona. A perfect place to combine sightseeing and relaxing. Humberto is a very welcoming host even from great distance. Everything was well organized. We' d love to come back."
360863,4405125,2013-05-03,3862672,Judit,"We had a great time in barcelona, stayed 8 nights at Humberto's place. The flat is comfortable, well located (you can find everything neraby: beach, Barceloneta Market, excellent bakery, good tapas bars, gorcery, etc.) and well equipped, as well. Humberto was a careful host, gave us detailed useful information where to go out/eat.<br/>I recommend his place."
360863,4532623,2013-05-11,5739380,Jörg,"The appartment was exactly as shown on the fotos, very clean and completly equiped as descriped and everything was organized perfect. We stayed for one week and had a real good time. The flat is only 5 minutes to walk from the beach and has a lot of nice small bars and shops around and only 10 to walk to the metro. If we would come to barcelona again we surely will stay at humbertos nice flat again. Thanks Humberto!"
360863,4663689,2013-05-19,2986934,Gretchen,"We are a family of 4 with two young kids that stayed for 9 days in Humberto's flat located in the Barceloneta area of Barcelona.   We have never met Humberto before but found him to be very friendly, personable, helpful and responsive to our messages and requests.  All of our communication was via the AirBnB private messaging, we never met him in person, but that did not matter since everything was well organized.<br/><br/>On the day of our arrival we came at 10am and he allowed us to drop off our luggage to the room and pick up the keys from housekeeping staff.  The housekeeper was there upon arrival and even helped me carry my heavy bag up the stairs since my husband had not arrived yet. We waited at a nearby restaurant on the beach as the room was being cleaned (guests prior to us had just checked out that morning) and were able to get into the room by 1:30pm.  Check out was also very easy, we just left the room locked with the keys sitting on the kitchen counter.  <br/><br/>Everything in the room was as pictured except the animal skin rug is no longer there. The room was very clean and everything you need is there. There were plenty of towels, laundry detergent and auto dish detergent for the dish washer.  You can see the ocean from the balcony when you look to the right. You can also see the ocean from the bedroom window.<br/><br/>We felt the location was perfect, being just a 2 minute walk from the beach and a 2-3 minute walk to a large fresh market, bakery and restaurants.  Our kids enjoyed the web playground structure on the beach and of course playing in the water.  We were there at least one hour of every day of our trip, even though it was a bit windy and cold.<br/><br/>The area surrounding the flat was safe, even late at night.  We arrived to the flat near 12am one night and the street was well lit leading up to the building as well as at the front door.  The neighbors inside the building were fairly quiet and we did not notice them coming and going from the building much. The area around the flat was busy during the day with foot traffic and a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights up until late- but it was not a crazy party type of noise, more of the sounds of people talking inside the bars and restaurants and flamenco guitar music. It did not really keep us awake, we just noticed it as we were going to sleep late.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good experience for us, even with the 6 flights of stairs to climb :-)  Our kids enjoyed the stairs too much, we had to remind them not to race to the top. We definitely recommend his place and we would stay there again!"
360863,4829662,2013-05-28,1309787,Jamie,Humberto's place was very nice and in a perfect location. He was a great host who was very easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend his apartment as a place to stay.
97529,747353,2011-11-27,234605,Barbara,Cesc has been a great host. we would like to stay in his wonderful apartment again!
97529,966810,2012-03-03,1726911,ILias,"Overall it was a lovely stay at Cesc's apartment. <br/><br/>Positives:<br/>1. Cute apartment with minimal decoration. <br/>2. Good location. Only 350 meters from Joanic metro station on L4 & 6 blocks on a down hill to Sagrada Familia. Close proximity to mini market & supermarkets which are on the way to the apartment from Joanic metro.<br/>3. Furnished adequately, Washing machine was a bonus since we stayed 7 days. Wifi was handy but slow. <br/>4.  Safe area. <br/>5. Cesc the owner was hospitable & caring, he asked before we arrived if we needed a TV & he made sure to provide a brand new one. <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>1. Sound proofing is an issue with this building apartment. The slightest of moves could be heard loud and clear from the apartment on top. It might prove challenging for light sleepers. <br/><br/>2. Although a grill is available in the microwave, a small size oven would come in handy if you would like to cook. <br/> <br/><br/>"

Situé très près de la plage, des boîtes et du casino. <br/>Humberto est un hôte prudent et très sympathique, il est disponible en cas de soucis. <br/>Attention toutefois pour les personnes fatigués il y' a 5 étages à grimper, c'est sportif lorsqu'on est pas en pleine forme !<br/><br/>Je conseille cet appartement !"
97529,3625302,2013-02-26,3757607,Fabrizio,"L'appartamento é molto funzionale, pulitissimo, localizzato in ottima posizione nel centro di Barcellona, nei pressi di 2 fermate della metropolitana. Il proprietario é gentilissimo e con molte attenzioni. Esperienza molto positiva sicuramente da ripetere."
97529,3762303,2013-03-12,4887348,Beth,"Really comfortable, very pretty apartment in an amazing location (especially if you're planning on spending some time with Gaudí at La Sagrada Familia & Park Guell). I loved it & would return in a second! Cesc is a very fine host-- extremely friendly & forthcoming with information. A wonderful experience!"
97529,4120653,2013-04-11,5122011,Diego,"El apartamento de Cesc en Sagrada Familia me ha encantado por estar bien comunicado, estar próximo a sitios turísticos que poder visitar, lo estupendamente equipado que está y por lo luminoso que es. <br/><br/>Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados a todos los que deseen hacer turismo por Barcelona o simplemente quieran conocer la ciudad.<br/><br/>Cesc es un gran anfitrión: amable, comunicativo, de trato exquisito y siempre abierto a mejorar la experiencia de sus huéspedes."
97529,4388962,2013-05-02,4839865,Frédéric,"L'appartement est un peu lion des centres d’intérêts. Toutefois, les lieux touristiques à Barcelone sont dispersés et la situation de convient très bien. Il y a une multitude de petits commerces aux alentours et l'appartement donne dans une cour intérieur, très calme. L’ameublement est de bon gout, le lit agréable, l'équipement très bien...et l’accueil par Cesc chaleureux. Donc, tout bien pour un agréable séjour à Barcelone!"

Busstation Nr. 55 ca. 5 Minuten zu Fuß, fährt zu Placa Catalunya (Zentrum), nächste Metrostation L4, ca. 8 Minuten zu Fuß, fährt zu Parceig de Garcia, Hauptgeschäftsstraße.<br/><br/>Wir (2 Personen) haben uns SEHR wohl gefühlt! Würden diese Wohnung jederzeit wieder buchen. Auch Cesc ist ein wunderbarer Gastgeber und sehr hilfsbereit.<br/><br/>Tipp: Wer Sagrada Familia anschauen möchte, geht am besten erst am Nachmittag (ca. 17 Uhr). Dann ist Warteschlange kürzer und man hat noch immer genügend Zeit um mit Aufzug zum Turm raufzufahren. In  der Früh ist die Warteschlange extram lang!"

18674,41087522,2015-08-04,35231385,Shlomi,"Big apartment, well equipped.<br/>Very good service, excellent location.<br/>Recommended."
18674,81000756,2016-06-20,23223644,Joost,"The Check in was fast and flexible. The price is fair, because the flat ist big enough for 8 people if you are flexible as well. We were the in a time where it wasn't so hot outside, so I have no idea how hot it can get inside. This was my second Airbnb stay so I can't compare it so good with other apartments but I would wish me, that the owner, offers the guests more toilet paper  etc. . Because if it is a short stay, you don't want to buy all the staff in big packages. <br/>All in all we are very happy with this decision "
18674,278588962,2018-06-18,4756672,Marius,"Great location and enough space in the apartment for 7 people. Although the mattresses were a bit too soft and the house is quite noisy, its a solid choice for a big group of people for a weekend in barcelona."
18674,408388148,2019-02-04,118847863,Sonora,"Our experience here was mixed. <br/>The location of this flat is super close to La Sagrada Familia, and there are lots of cute restaurants and cafes nearby. <br/>The flat itself wad impersonal and not well represented by the photos. The folks who rent this spot have a bunch of other places in the city. So even though it was spacious, it lacked charm, and was heavily used without being heavily cleaned.<br/>There were extra pillows, but no extra pillow cases; the one spare blanket was covered in unwashed food stains (as was the furniture); and while the large bed was comfy, the small bed I slept in felt like laying on a box filled with metal springs. <br/>I have an Airbnb if my own, and work very hard to accurately represent my space. It was disappointing not to find that to be the case here.<br/>That said, check-in was easy, and when we had trouble with the heater, the response was quick."
18674,434013302,2019-04-07,23884550,Desirée,"Super fast and easy check-in and very friendly service. The price is fair and the apartment has enough space for 7 people. The locations of this flat is amazing. There are lots of cute restaurants, cafes and supermarkets nearby. More or less 3min walking distance to la Sagrada Familia, few bus stops and a metro station close by. <br/>During our stay it wasn't so hot outside so we needed to turn on the heater. It takes a while until it warms up the flat so you may can feel cold as we did."
18674,437816369,2019-04-15,12182090,Kevin,Amazing flat at a great location in Central Barcelona. Will definitely​ recommend.

18674,447343763,2019-05-03,124511137,Natalia,Un apartamento bonito y bien ubicado!
18674,449270399,2019-05-06,87311585,Diego,Todo bien. Como oportunidad recomendaria mejorar la aislacion de ruido y de calor. Se sentían ruidos de otros departamentos y era frío.
18674,455900271,2019-05-20,144073316,Pamela,"Buena ubicación, linda vista."
18674,463457868,2019-06-03,133074241,Jon,"Great Location with a lovely morning view of the Segrada Família. Anna from Barcelona4seasons was punctual and exceptionally helpful in advising on the best way to spend our time in Barcelona. <br/>The apartment was clean, slightly quirky and had everything we needed. The building itself could do with a facelift and the lift is a little tight but all in all a very comfortable stay."
360863,5382767,2013-06-27,3567579,Charlotte,"Humberto's flat is bright and clean, as in the pictures, and situated very close to the beach and promenade. There is a large supermarket as well as local shops, bars, cafes and restaurants nearby - Humberto very kindly gave us a long list of recommendations. We stayed towards the end of June, the weekend of the Festival of San Juan so there were lots of fireworks and festivities.  I would recommend this flat for a stay in this lovely city that has everything to offer. "
360863,5528729,2013-07-04,6734568,Martin,"We had a really great time in Barcelona. Humberto gave us lots of helpful information about the neighborhood and some activities. The flat is very comfortable, bright and clean like you can see in the pictures. The location is perfect because it's near to the beach and city. <br/>I definitely recommend this place!<br/>"
360863,5727709,2013-07-14,5601889,Victoria,I truly enjoyed my stay at Humberto's flat! Was just as the pictures depicted & very close to all the sights of Barcelona.  Humberto made the transition from the airport to the flat flawless.  I would highly recommend his place to anyone coming to Barcelona.
360863,5969286,2013-07-24,299035,James,"I had a nice stay in humbertos apartment , very clean , nice kitchen , bathroom . It was hot while I was there the air cond worked really well . Great location I would book again to stay here and be near the beach. Humberto is great to deal with , I highly recommend it."
360863,8332363,2013-10-26,8831293,Kathleen + Will,"We had a wonderful, magical time in Barcelona, and Barceloneta.  Our host Humberto, whom we had the pleasure to meet, was so helpful, and responsible in all aspects of renting the apartment to us.  From having Juana meet us at the apartment, asking if there was anything we needed, to helping us with our bags.   The apartment is all that you need for your stay.  It has been renovated,  with Ikea cabinets, so it is compact, and meets the spacial challenge of a small unit.  A very comfortable platform bed, great shower, stove top expresso machine.  What more could you ask for?  I leave the 4-5 floor walk up for last, as it was a challenge but by the end of the trip we could walk all the way without stopping.  I loved the stairs when we got home as we both lost weight from all the walking, bicycling, swimming, and stair master that we did, not to mention all the great food!  I would highly recommend  Humberto as your host while in Barcelona.  We actually rented both his flats, the other one Barri Gotic for our first week, and the Barceloneta flat for the second week.  Both were great locations."
360863,9692694,2014-01-05,4672805,Mauro,"My Girlfriend and I spent the 2014 new year eve in Barcelona. <br/>We were looking for a place that was nice, close to the beach, to the city but quite at the same time. <br/><br/>We found Humberto’s place and for sure we recommend this solution to anyone interested in a pleasant stay in Bacelona. <br/><br/>The pros: <br/>- the host: Humberto is really caring of his guests;<br/>- the flat: very well equipped (air-conditioning, washing machine, dishwasher, full set of pots). It is small, but extremely functional. <br/>- the location: 2 minutes walking from the see, the barceloneta and the Olympic harbor. <br/><br/>The cons: <br/>- the building is not really good looking and the stairs are not well maintained at all<br/>- 5th floor without a lift (not that bad anyway at the end)"
360863,11997363,2014-04-21,8767467,Elisabeth,"L'appartement est très agréable et conforme  aux photos. Petit ( max  3 personnes) mais bien agencé et refait à neuf ce qui n'est pas si fréquent dans cette partie de la ville. L'immeuble et les parties communes sont en assez mauvais état et l'immeuble n'est pas très engageant vu de l'extérieur, mais l'appartement est parfait. Il est chauffé et climatisé, cuisine et SDB modernes. <br/>Le 5e étage permet d'être au calme dans ce quartier vivant et bruyant la journée mais avec peu de voitures et calme le soir. C'est un quartier populaire où tout le monde se connaît et où on peut vivre comme des barcelonais : les touristes n'y font que passer. Il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour faire ses courses, un marché et un supermarché. <br/>La plage est vraiment tout près et c'est une partie un peu moins moins fréquentée du front de mer donc très agréable, avec une aire de jeux et des appareils de musculation. Il y a aussi un parc à côté. <br/>Humberto est un hôte très présent, il n'habite pas sur place mais reste en contact tout au long de votre voyage pour s'assurer que vous soyez accueillie par Juana qui vous attend à l'appartement. Elle ne parle pas français mais Humberto s'arrange pour être joignable à tout moment. <br/>Le métro est à 10 mn, la station Barceloneta sur la ligne 4 permet de parcourir toute la ville, mais on peut aussi aller à pied jusqu'au barri Gothic, las Ramblas  ou le Born. C'est donc un endroit parfait pour loger au calme et avoir de l'air. Les enfants adorent. <br/>Le seul bémol est le voisin !! Comme dit sur l'annonce il est très sensible au bruit et se plaint sans arrêt donc si vous avez des enfants un minimum turbulents (comme des enfants), ça risque d'être pénible. Attention aussi à l'escalier qui est très étroit ( 5 étages sans ascenseur)  : facile si on est en forme physique normale, mais évitez l'énorme valise ou  si vous êtes en surpoids !<br/>Pour conclure une excellente solution très abordable pour qui veut vivre une vie de barcelonais et profiter de la plage après avoir arpenté la ville, mais la nécessité de calme évoquée dans l'annonce est réelle à cause du voisin pénible. "
360863,13565962,2014-05-31,7359130,Tom,"Humberto a été un hôte disponible et soucieux de nous donner le maximum d'informations pour découvrir Barcelone et passer de super vacances. L'appartement est conforme à l'annonce, propre, fonctionnel, moderne et très agréable. Super adresse pour s'immerger dans la vie Barcelonaise !<br/>Merci à toi Humberto."
18674,480168541,2019-07-02,13969136,Burc,"Nice place next to sagrada , a bit far from downtown and the beaches tough. Kitchen facilities are good , bedrooms are ok for 6 people. One bathroom is good sie but the small one was really very small. Furnitures and overall equipment were new. Towels , linens etc were very clean."
18674,501793870,2019-08-04,7806670,Jerome,"Appartement bien situé. Les matelas ne sont pas top, un peu trop mou et la clim est quasi inexistante. Donc difficile de dormir sans climatisation dans les chambres."
18674,526688056,2019-09-09,277727385,Julio,Es un gran apartamento con todas las comodidades. Esta a 2 cuadras de Sagrada Familia y de la estación. Puedes llegar caminando a otros lugares de interés de Barcelona. Es un gran lugar para descansar luego de recorrer la ciudad!
18674,544887011,2019-10-11,38214,Frank,"This place is conveniently located close to the Sagrada Familia and public transport.  It was very spacious and great for larger families or groups.  Checking into the place was done remotely so make sure your phone is charged when arriving at the place as we had to call our hosts when we arrived and they buzzed us in.  Unfortunately, I think I was allergic to something in the apartment as my eyes become itchy and watered when I was in the unit but cleared up when we went outside. Once I got allergy medicine from the pharmacy It helped me to enjoy my stay and we were out exploring the city most of the time.  Also, we were told and agreed upon a prompt 11 am check out time but were awoken at 8 am by the next guest entering the unit with keys...?  After a brief language barrier (she was Italian) we agreed to check out early since we were already up, while she left her luggage in the unit and left to give us our space/time.    The unit itself was clean and a great deal for the price/location.  We are very laid back people so these two little upsets really didn't affect our wonderful time exploring Barcelona."
18674,546913674,2019-10-14,240594959,Dinah,"The apartment is lovely, its spacious and has plenty of areas to relax when you're at home. The flat is also well connected and easy to get to from all areas of Barcelona. A great place for a group of friends who want a comfortable, clean and safe place to hang out before heading into Barcelona for the day / night."

18674,612101294979598070,2022-04-24,123280023,Daniëlle,Wij hadden een kort maar prima verblijf in dit appartement. De communicatie met de host was goed en ze was erg behulpzaam. De locatie is erg goed met mooi uitzicht op de Kathedraal.
18674,638222583889413519,2022-05-30,14303175,Gema,"Es un apartamento enorme con las habitaciones en la parte del apartamento que no da a la calle, con lo cual es una delicia para dormir y descansar. La zona del salón con la terracota es muy agradable para desayunar viendo la Sagrada Familia. Muy recomendable."
18674,700532688387587838,2022-08-24,413294291,Luis,"I’m really disappointed about the whole experience to be honest. First of all, We arrange a checkout hour the first day, then the owner told us that we had to leave earlier and the last day she told us that we have to leave even earlier, so communication was terrible.<br/>The kitchen flood as soon as we arrive and they fixed the next day so we didn’t have kitchen for 2 of the 3 days basically . But I think the worst part was that they actually told us when we did the check in and after we paid that we he to be extremely quiet during night (which wasn’t in the house rules or anything) because if we did any noises the neighbors will call the police and if that happens we had to leave the apartment right away. There was actually a sign in the building lobby that said that if there was any inconvenient with the “tourist apartment” call the police. So we really don’t recommend this experience for anyone. Also the description said the the  had Air conditioning, and there was only AC at the to living rooms and one didn’t even work. So the rooms are super hot"

18674,713612711374507594,2022-09-11,13992554,Rob,"Before I start my review, I just want to let you know that I am a long-standing Air BNBer with lots of positive reviews. I have generally had good experiences but this stay was not good.<br/>Firstly the property is not run by Mirea & Maria but by a property management company, Barcelona4Seasons. I point this out because a big draw for me to this property was that I would be dealing with members of the LGBTIQ+ community. It’s worth noting this. Communications ahead of time were generally good and they were responsive. There was however a significant problem which led to my party abandoning the property.  <br/>The apartment is fantastically located in Sagrada Familia district. The apartment is an older apartment block and is definitely ‘vintage’. <br/> <br/>The problem is that there are significant building works going on to the rear of the apartment. These are major. They look like they have been there for some time and are likely to continue for several months. They create significant noise pollution which is heard throughout the apartment but specifically loudest at the rear of the building where 2 of the bedrooms are located. There is significant dust and debris produced by the building works also. <br/>This will have several impacts on your stay:<br/>- unless you are a deep sleeper you are likely to be woken during the day by the building works.<br/>- you will not be able to return to the apartment during the day as any rest you may wish to take will be impacted by the works.<br/>- you will be unable to leave the rear apartment windows open during the day because of the dust.<br/>I think therefore currently this would not make for a good holiday/tourist stay. It might be appropriate if you are staying for work.<br/>My friends who arrived first during the afternoon discovered this problem and refused to stay. They felt unsafe and, as this was part of their honeymoon, I don’t blame them. They recorded good video footage which shows the extent of the building works and the noise pollution. I am happy to share this on request.<br/>I immediately reported this to Barcelona4Seasons on my arrival. They denied knowledge of this significant building project and were unable to offer a refund or to rehouse us. They stated that they were unaware of these works. I find this comment surprising given that cleaners are coming into the apartment regularly and the scale of work. We were therefore obliged to find alternative accomodation and I am actively pursuing a refund.<br/>My stay was on the8th September and am writing this on 24 th September. I have looked at the listing today and note that no mention is made of the property management company or the building works. I would have hoped to have been told about the building works ahead of my stay as this would have impacted my  choice to stay here. I hope this helps you make an informed choice ahead of your stay. <br/>I hope by the time you read this the omissions in the listing have been updated as this could have been a great spot to stay were it not for the conditions."

The location was amazing, with views of the Sagrada Familia, and many places were walking distance. It accommodated the 7 of us easily and the highlight for us were the bathrooms. We spent more time outside the apartment than inside, and it served us as a great place to come back from a day of exploring to rest, recover, and rejuvenate ourselves for more exploration! <br/>The listing is as advertised and the host was very responsive, and while we didn’t make any particular requests during the stay, I’m sure they would’ve been answered promptly."
