I live in Barcelona, an ideal city because of its climate, beaches and cultural events.

I like to offer an atmosphere of harmony and happiness, as any kind of tip and help for finding out curious corners of the city that are not usually easy to find. 
I speak Catalan, Spanish, English and Italian. I understand Portuguese.

If you have any question, please don't hesitate to ask me.
Looking forward to meeting you!

Our management comprises different phases, from the initial search of clients, reception and accommodation in the apartment until his departure. We also take care of the apartment all clean and conditioning time, and to resolve any issues that may arise during a guest's stay.
The main goal of our management is twofold:

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a ""friend"" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city.

I was born in Hungary, but I have been lucky enough to have lived most of my life abroad. We moved to Canada when I was only 3 and with 2 intermissions in Hungary I have also lived in the United States, Sweden and now in Spain.

After such a “busy” childhood and youth perhaps it’s not surprising that I went on to get a degree in Social Anthropology (in Sweden, where I moved to with my parents at 17). But of course 5 years of dark and rainy grey weather takes its toll on the soul and I decided to take a leap and moved to Barcelona to study Spanish. Since Barcelona is a very attractive city I decided to stay a bit longer and got my master’s in Cultural Management. Right after finishing I started working for a small design agency. I completed a masters degree in art therapy and am currently looking for opportunities to work in the field. And in the mean time I teach English as a freelance teacher.
